WIPS : PyTorch implementation of the paper "Representation Learning with Weighted Inner Product for Universal Approximation of General Similarities"
=======================================================

**WIPS** is an open source implementation of the paper "[Representation Learning with Weighted Inner Product for Universal Approximation of General Similarities](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/699)." IJCAI-19.

The code will be updated soon.

## Requirements & Test Environment

- Python3
- PyTorch 1.1.0
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- tqdm
- Tested on CentOS Linux release 7.4.1708

## Acknowledgements

The implementation is based on [SIPS](https://github.com/kdrl/SIPS), see also the implementation of the AISTATS-19 paper "Graph Embedding with Shifted Inner Product Similarity and Its Improved Approximation Capability".
Some of the code is also based on [Facebook's poincare-embeddings](https://github.com/facebookresearch/poincare-embeddings), see also their implementation of the NIPS-17 paper "Poincar√© Embeddings for Learning Hierarchical Representations".
